Hello! If you need to know more about me click the about page. Here are some of my projects:

----

## Onewave

This is my only completed project to date, and I am very proud of it. It is an Android App
to connect to and display information about Onewheels. [Github](https://github.com/Nanoux/Onewave)

## Bus in a Desert

This is a relatively polished project for me. It is a clone of the original Desert Bus but with
modern 3D graphics, with Procedural Infinite Terrain, 100% custom assets and all. [Github](https://github.com/Nanoux/Bus-in-a-Desert)

## Multiplayer Racing

This one is awesome. It has a custom level editor with procedural terrain, in which you can place
various things, and then race on it with friends, and everything syncs up. [Github](https://github.com/Nanoux/Tef-Racing-Thingy)

## 3D Game of Life

This project turned out amazing, it actually feels finished. It allows you to create 3D initial
conditions, then run customizable rules in the style of Game of Life on it until your computer melts. [Github](https://github.com/Nanoux/Game-of-Life)

## SpaceX Lander

This is one of my first projects, and it requires an HTC Vive to work. It is a crude simulation of
landing a Falcon 9 rocket on a barge thats actually quite fun. [Github](https://github.com/Nanoux/SpaceX-Lander)

## Bark Bark

I have no idea why this exists but it still makes me laugh and I love it. [Github](https://github.com/Nanoux/Bark-Bark-Thing)

[This one really deserves a GIF too](https://imgur.com/TVqJ8GU)

#### I have a few other notable projects that are not on Github, either because they are too big, don't work anymore, or never worked in the first place.

----

## ISS Interior

I found a super awesome model of the interior of the ISS on NASA's website, so I put it in VR and made
a 0 G navigation mechanic. It was actually a lot of fun.

## Aerospace Sim

I love the game KSP and have wanted multiplayer for it forever, so I gave it a shot. I spent a semester
making a craft editor, physics model, planetary terrain system, and netcode for it. It because a jumbled
mess of bugs, and as a result there's not much to show, but I'm proud I got as far as I did so fast.
