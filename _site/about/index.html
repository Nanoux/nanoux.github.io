<p>Hello, my name is Ryan Campbell, but I go by Nanoux on the internet. I have had a strong passion for coding my entire life. It started out with making crazy
redstone projects in Minecraft back in 2011. I then made the jump into Unity a few years later, and started many projects over several years. Most of those
projects can be found on the main page of this website or on my <a href="https://github.com/Nanoux?tab=repositories">Github</a>. Over this past summer I also made a
complete Android App for myself. It won’t do much for you if you don’t own a Onewheel electric board, but the source code may be interesting nonetheless.
Thank you for checking out my website! I’m currently looking for internships, or even a full time job if you feel I’m qualified. My email is ryancampbell244@gmail.com.</p>
